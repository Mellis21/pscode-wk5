// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

ask for one Number

check if number is odd or even
print if number is odd or even

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

(a + b + c + d + e)/5 = f

(num1 + num2 + num3 + num4 + num5)/5 = AVG

ask for 5 numbers

add the 5 numbers together
divide the sum of the numbers by 5
print on the screen "The average is" followed by the average of the 5 numbers

find the lowest and highest number of the five numbers 
print "the lowest and highest number respectively are" followed by the lowest and highest of the five numbers
